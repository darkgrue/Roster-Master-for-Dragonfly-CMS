Changelog:
* TODO: Check for new key quests. Would appreciate any feedback on useful quests to include here (such as relevant raid flags).
* TODO: Migrate remaining administrative functions to panel (maybe - they might be more convenient where they are).

9.1.1
* Corrected version number in file headers.
* Made some changes to parser logic to make it less fragile to anomalies in the
  Census data, thanks to Demetrios for finding the issue.
* Fixed some spelling errors in comments.
* Added sort of collection quest by number collected.
* Improved highlighting style of missing collection objects.
* Added count of collection quests that have not been started.

* Added new collections for Chaos Descending (GU108).

9.1.0
* Improved Alt logic.
* Added the ability to show only claimed characters in Quest Master. Thanks to
  Tulvarus, for the feature suggestion.
* Fixed bug in Quest Master where resort links weren't preserving Expansion
  selections.
* Query Quest Status now honors the current show_alts and show claimed
  characters search options.
* Added vertical centering to sort checkboxes and radio button labels.
* Replaced references to http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/ with
  http://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq2/ link.
* Fixed database errors with references to "rm.id".
* Fixed problem with multiple crc entries for the same characterID being
  present in the roster_master_quest_status table.
* Fixed old RM4DF version number in sigblock templates.
* Fixed Signature Master not pulling signature block avatars from the correct
  subdirectories and defaulting to the eq2 logos.
* Some template cleanup.
* Moved administration display strings into language file.
* Additional diagnostics messages.
* Cleaned up installer's database upgrade strategy.
* Remove obsolete statistics from block.
* Updated documentation.
* Updated contib/history.sql file to reflect new events.
* New feature: addition of Collection Master!
  + Reports on a character's collection quests.
  + Like Quest Master, automatically updated from Census.
  + Note: Collection Master can only know about collection quests that exist
    in Census, quests have been known to be held back for new expansions.
* Reworked parser to increase efficiency:
  + Reduced use of globals and reworked data structures to be more efficient
    for write operations, rather than replicate the structures used to build
	the roster pages.
  + SQL query optimizations.
  + Massive speed improvements during roster update; NOTE: this comes at the
    cost of detailed logging of roster changes (eliminating the loops to do
	comparisons solely for logging purposes had a significant performance
	cost).
  + Removed XML parsers in favor of JSON, for a 25% data savings advantage.
* Thanks to Feldon with helping with the Census query syntax and suggestions
  on effeciency improvements.

8.2.1
* Thanks to Dethdlr to reporting numerous errors in the 8.2.0 release that
  somehow got overlooked:
  + Replaced missing themes\default\template\roster_master\do_commands.html
    file.
  + Fixed templating errors.
  + Fixed SQL error message in adwait.inc file.
  + Changed cast of BIGINT data items to PHP string instead of integer to
    fix issue with 32-bit systems that have PHP_INT_SIZE=4.
  + Found Dragonfly CMS dependency on version 9.5.2.1 of template_enc.php
    file.
  + Fixed extended Guild Wall of Fame statistics broken links to character

* Alts list no longer lists the character it is for as an alt of itself.
* Alt lists now sorted using natural sort.
* Updated documentation.
* Fixed bad math in diagnostic time display in Guild Wall of Fame block.
* Fixed error in parser.inc involving closing the cURL filehandle

* Changed last_update to DECIMAL(19,7) as per 3/20/2012 REST API.
* Fixed roster alt displaying empty alt list (it's possible to have an
  altlist that only contains the character it's attached to - that is, if
  opt-in is set for a character, REST always considers it an alts of
  itself).

8.2.0
* Redirected guild and character detail links to the brand-new EQU site.
  Grats Dethdlr and Feldon, well done!
* Added files to modules/Roster_Master/contrib/GEM to address inteface
  issues with GEM.
* Added mod_expires directive to .htacces files in static image
  directories to request clients cache for 60 days. Requires that the 
  Apache mod_expires module be active.
* Added cURL support to allow Content-Encoding compression methods to
  operate if available. Using cURL for this purpose allows the server to
  benefit considerably from compression on the XML requests. The feature
  Falls back automagically to the previously used internal fsockopen()
  method if cURL isn't available.
* Fixed templating for characters that don't have data in the Character
  collection.
* Fixed missing Soulfire Timeline Quest icon.
* Fixed missing language definition for _CONFRESET dialog.
* Added new interface icons.
* Fixed many broken image links.
* Added (rudimentary) alts display to roster.
* Fixed language file collisions that conflict with other modules.
* Fixed group by guild rank display.

8.1.0
* Redid DoV Heritage Quest icons to reflect item types better.
* Added modules/Roster_Master/contrib/rn2a/includes/api/rmdfly.php file
  to address inteface issues with Raid Ninja.
* Reworked the upgrade to v8.0.0 to resolve installer issue. Rebuilding
  the roster_master table (a known issue in 8.0.0-8.0.1) should no
  longer be necessary.
* Fixed error introduced by changes to sync_active_claims() function.
* Added modules/Roster_Master/contrib/history.sql file to build your own
  This Day in History table with EverQuest, EverQuest II, and a few
  other relevant dates. Please use care with the .sql file, as it
  includes a table drop statement, it will erase your existing history
  table.
* Added more robust function checks in the diagnostics page.
* Changed guild name search string filtering and made it explicit the
  Guild ID search can use regular expression syntax. Thanks to eqHunter
  for reporting it.
* Implemented parser changes from the 1/31/2012 API changes.

8.0.1
* Fixed usage of the URL class that got ahead of the Dragonfly version 9
  users, that's a class that's introduced in Version 10. Thanks to
  Nashbry for reporting it.

8.0.0
* Version 8 is the first use of the new SOE data server and the REST
  API. Thanks to Zoltaroth and Dan Kinney at SOE for implementing this
  and staying involved with the community. Also a big thanks to Feldon
  and Dethdlr at EQ2Wire for their assitance in gettin the Roster Master
  project talking to the right people. And finally thanks to Lantis for
  making things happen and pioneering the Roster Master port to the new
  data interface.
* Added Destiny of Velious Heritage Quests.
* Fixed quest reward link text for Paw of Opolla heritage quest.
* Created new Administraton panel and moved most (of the infrequently
  used) administrative functions there.
  + New Lookup Guild ID function added to administration panel.
  + New Unclaimed Characters display added to the Dragonfly
    administration panel status area.
* Improvements to diagnostics page style and tests.
* Fixed error in roster expiration duration warning.
* Updated rm4df_update.sh shell script to reflect new data sources.
* Added Beastlord class to the Scout archetype.
* Extensive changes to the parser. Most (but not nearly all) available
  data fields are parsed, but are not currently templated for display.
  Thanks to Lantis for collaborating on parser design and other
  internals.
* Nonexistant avatar and rank image files are no longer fatal errors in
  Signature Master.
* Fixed longstanding error with the avatar CLASS keyword that prevented
  it from working correctly in Signature Master.
* Guild Wall of Fame block has been updated with new field data, new
  leaderboards.
* Added class, race, rank, and tradeskill images to the roster template.
  Thanks to Seagoat to take the time to get these out of the DDS format
  and into the more palatable PNG format we all like to use, as well
  as graciously consenting to allow her efforts to be included in the
  RM4DF distribution.
* More debugging hooks for my development use, and a few more
  informational system logs (e.g. execution times are now collected for
  the roster).
* CONFIG CHANGE: As field name have changed, names in the Signature
  Master templates have changed. See the template_variables.csv file to
  see what template names are available. Also refer to the example.
  Signature Master generates the 'FullName', 'Server', and
  'guild_rankname' internally, which are also available for templating.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The structure of the 'images' directory has changed to
  facilitate the new roster logic and column templates.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The semantics of the $config['columns'] variable have
  changed. Refer to the config.inc file.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Custom character avatars have been moved into the
  'characterId' subdirectory of the 'avatar' directory, where they were
  previously, to help with file organization.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Removed $config['use_XML_parser'] parameter from the
  config.inc file, input is all XML now.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Removed $config['lookup_rank'] parameter from the
  config.inc file, ranks are parsed from guild XML now.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Changed $config['officers'] and
  $config['exclude_ranks'] to use rank numbers now, instead of rank
  names. Should eliminate the need to update the configuration for most
  guild structures.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Removed $config['breakdown_limit20plus'], as the pre-
  Level 20 classes have been eliminated from gameplay.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The name of the theme templates directory has changed
  from 'rostermaster' to 'roster_master' to maintain consistency with
  the module directory name.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The refresh period set by $config['cache_update_time']
  hes been changed from 6 hours to 1 hour, since now new data should be
  available as soon as a character zones or logs out. For now, be wary
  of giving this a low value, until performance issues are better
  understood.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The French language file has been removed, as I'm
  unable to maintain it. Any Francophile who wishes to take a stab at it
  is welcome to submit it to the project.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Both the roster_master and roster_master_guild
  tables have changed significantly, and will be in flux for the near
  future.
* Updated documentation.
* KNOWN ISSUE: The Dragonfly installer may behave in a nondeterministic 
  fashion during the upgrade process, performing a table DROP after,
  instead of before a CREATE. If you see errors indicating your 
  roster_master table is missing, recreate it by using the included
  roster_master.sql file with the Import SQL File function in the
  Dragonfly Database administration panel. You will need to edit the
  table names in the file if you have a different table prefix or
  suffix.

7.2.1
* Fixed a secondary issue with characterId being cast to an integer and
  getting overflowed. Bug reported by dsotmlynx.
* Added additional parser diagnostics for parser processing failure
  (caused during January 12, 2011 outage of EQ2Players.com).

7.2.0
* Fixed a long-standing bug in the sig_image_rewrite_hack feature. This
  would cause installations where the server root and Dragonfly root
  were not the same to fail to perform the image rewrite correctly (the
  rewrite rule always assumed the roots were the same). This fix, along
  with the new diagnostics page, should allow the hack to work on nearly
  all systems that meet the prequisites, as well as make it clearer why
  it doesn't work on systems that don't meet them. Big thanks to
  Demetrios for working ceaselessly with me to work this feature out.
* Added automated diagnostics to determine what features are available
  from the CMS module. This is the page you'll want to look at first
  when troubleshooting RM4DF features, and it also has the information
  you'll need to know for reporting problems. The Diagnostics page is
  accessed from the RM4DF Administraion menu bar. Thanks to Demetrios
  for field-testing this feature before release.
* Moved Signature Master system diagnostics from that module to the new
  Diagnostics page. The $DEBUG flag still enables debugging information
  for that module, but now it's limited to runtime error diagnosis.
* Signature Master no longer defaults to an internal default signature
  block template if the corresponding template file cannot be located.
  It will continue to default to default_sigblock.png as the default
  signature block image if the image configured in
  $config['sigblock_basename'] cannot be located; however, there is now
  a default_sigblock.txt file that contains the corresponding signature
  block template. If the image file exists, but the template does not,
  Signature Master will now return a 404 error (or an appropriate DF
  error if the Signature Master $DEBUG flag is set).
* Fixed quest link for Paw of Opolla heritage quest.
* Added in missing heritage quest icons. Thanks to penbrock for pointing
  out the oversight.
* Updated rm4df_update.sh script.
* Corrected minor typos in comments and templates.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added roster avatars option "CLASS" for the
  $config['avatars'] setting. Feature requested by Demetrios, class
  icons extracted and contributed by Seagoat.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Removed $config['show_lastname'] from the config.inc
  file, as this setting has been nonfunctional since version 7.0.0 -
  you'll want to edit
  themes\default\template\rostermaster\rostermater.html to change the
  display characteristics of the roster (in other words, this parameter
  was removed as redundant with the purpose of the templates). In this
  case, you'd want to remove or comment out the
  {character_row.S_CHAR_LASTNAME} element in the template. Bug reported
  by Demetrios.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Roster Master no longer allows upgrades from versions
  older than 7.0.0 (Any versions prior to 7.1.1 aren't functional
  due to the everquest2.com structure changes anyway.) Users upgrading
  from a version prior to 7.0.0 must uninstall the previous version,
  then install 8.3.0. NOTE: Character claims will not be preserved (as
  per a fresh install).
* Updated documentation.

7.1.1
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: The characterID field used as a primary key in
  almost all of the RM4DF tables can overflow a INTEGER field, and needs
  to be increased to a BIGINT type. Bug and fix reported by Lantis.

7.1.0
* Added Sentinel's Fate Heritage Quests.
* Updated parser to use new EQ2Players source pages (now
  everquest2.com). Parser now has to get the server name from the Guild
  Summary page (parser has to complete at least once) before link to
  Guild page can be calculated and displayed. Requires that you update
  your config.inc file with the new one in this version in addition to
  the other changed files.
* Fixed long-standing error in the parser debug output (you wouldn't
  have noticed, confused me though).
* Added "Unknown" (the string, not something unknown) to language file.
* Added Sentinel's Fate Heritage and Timeline quests.
* Improved clarity of notifications and errors returned by the
  fetch_URL() function.

7.0.1
* Added The Shadow Odyssey Timeline quest.
* Fixed warning in questmaster.ini realted to missing required level
  in quest data.
* Fixed error in qm_manage_claims.html that caused inability to update
  any Access/Heritage/Timeline Quests. Bug reported by eqHunter
  and Crysthallia.

7.0.0
* Formatting change to command menu header (removed small tag).
* Formatting change to roster view (removed small tag, fixed radio
  button label wrapping).
* Fixed HTML syntax error in character heritage quest claims form.
* Fixed HTML syntax error in Quest Master.
* Removed use of nowrap="nowrap" tag in favor of inline CSS.
* Created the most "Dragonfly" version of RM4DF yet with the addition of
  full templating for the module. NOTE: Don't forget to install
  the new files located in the themes/default/template/rostermaster
  directory!
* Numerious minor errors in formatting and conditional formatting logic
  corrected (and most likely, added as well).
* Added sort to character heritage quest claims form.
* Moved include/ directory and its contents to the includes/ directory.
  NOTE: Don't forget to install the new files, or remove the old
  directory!
* Quest data moved to files in the includes/ directory. NOTE: Don't
  forget the new files or Quest Master won't work!

6.4.1
* Fixed typo in documentation.
* Fixed quest pointer for Dark Mail Gauntlets HQ.
* Fixed inexplicable field name change from "Average Member Level" to
  "AverageMemberLevel" in the data feed, which broke the HTML data
  scrubber. Bug reported by Lantis.

6.4.0
* Replaced usage of depreciated gmtime() function.
* Made RM4DF tolerant of the STRICT_TRANS_TABLES sql_mode being set. Bug
  reported by Jimena.
* Removed unecessary use of $BASEHREF that duplicated innate getlink()
  functionality.
* Fixed logspam where guild roster contained data that translated into
  HTML entities (such as in custom Guild Ranks). Bug reported by
  Wizairde.
* Fixed error in the is_visible property in questmaster.inc file.
* Added ability to filter quests by expansion.
* Added The Shadow Odyssey Heritage Quests to the Heritage Quest
  Tracker.
* Heritage quest tracker claim interface now groups by (and has header
  labels for) the applicable game expansion.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added experimental rewrite rule to work around BBCode
  IMG tag URI filters that prevent linking directly to a URI containing
  a query string. The URL to use should be of the form:
  {$BASEHREF}modules/{$mod_dirname}/sig_{$char_info['characterId']}.jpg
  but requires that Apache be complied with mod_rewrite.c enabled.
  If you wish to enable this UNSUPPORTED feature, see
  $config['sig_image_rewrite_hack'] in the config.inc file.

6.3.1
* Fixed horizontal avatar margins when LEFT alignment directive is used.
  Bug reported and fixed by Seagoat.
* Added "Optimize Tables" administrative command to delete all widowed
  and orphaned claims all at once.
* Added Rise of Kunark Raid Flagging Timeline to the Access Quest
  Tracker.
* Added link to cached signature image (when it is present in the cache)
  to the Edit Character Claim page. This is to help people work around
  URL filtering that some CMSes perform.
* The reap_sigcache() function now checks the cache for files that are
  excluded by the $config['exclude_ranks'] array.
* Added "Fill Signature Block Cache" administrative command to
  pregenerate the signature block cache for all valid characters.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['force_sig_cache'] directive to allow the
  selective regeneration of the signature block cache to be forced every
  time the roster data is updated. NOTE: Using this feature may cause
  Roster Master to exceed the maximum script execution time (see source
  for explanation).
* CONFIG CHANGE: Roster Master no longer allows upgrades from versions
  older than 6.0.0 (Any versions prior to 6.2.0 aren't functional
  due to the EQ2Players structure changes anyway.) Users upgrading from
  a version prior to 6.0.0 must uninstall the previous version, then
  install 6.5.0. NOTE: Character claims will not be preserved (as per
  a fresh install).

6.3.0
* Fixed problem for new installs where the Access Quest Tracker list
  would not including the character name, only the level. Bug reported
  by Bloo and Kelfly.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The default primary and secondary sort option and
  direction are now settable in the config.inc file. If an invalid
  configuration option is selected, the default fallback is still "r",
  "d", "al", "d". Feature suggested by Seagoat.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The default list grouping is now settable by
  $config['group_by'] in the config.inc file. If an invalid
  configuration option is selected, the default fallback is ungrouped.
  Feature suggested by Seagoat.
* Added A(bsolute) and I(nherit) modifiers to the size definition of the
  TEXT sigblock directive. Using an A immediately after the font size
  will mean turn off the text fitting and use the font size exactly as
  written. Using an I will use whatever the last font size selected
  (whether from auto-fit or as set). Feature suggested by Seagoat.
* Fixed roster grouping when not displaying a groupable primary sort.
* Fixed incorrect quest link. Bug reported by Bloo.
* CONFIG CHANGE: The formatted date string for the logfile and the "Last
  Updated" display on the guild roster is now configurable by the
  $config['updated_date_fmt'] and $config['logfile_date_fmt'] settings
  in the config.inc file.
* Changed include() to require() to protect against situations where the
  open_basedir restriction is in effect. Bug reported by Apina.
* NULL, "Unskilled", and "none" fields now sort last.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['short_titles'] setting to specify if
  short heading titles will always be used, never used, or only when
  columns are grouped. Featured suggesed by Seagoat.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['columns'] setting to control what
  columns appear in the roster, and in what order. Feature suggested by
  Seagoat.
* CONFIG CHANGE: $config['show_avatars'] renamed to $config['avatars'],
  semantics and default changed.
* CONFIG CHANGE: removed $config['show_usernames'], option superseded by
  $config['columns'] setting.
* Row grouping is now enabled for Secondary Tradeskill Class in addition
  to the already available Character Type, Rank, Adventurer Class, and
  Artisan Class.
* Fixed problem affecting guilds with "Anonymous" characters not being
  added to the parse correctly. Changed $parsed_roster_data to
  superglobal for storage consistency and indexed by characterId rather
  than name. Bug reported by Lantis.
* Fixed header row alignment problem. Bug reported by Seagoat.
* Fixed logfile spam (symptom of database roster not being read
  correctly on roster update). Bug reported by Seagoat.

6.2.0
* CONFIG CHANGE: Removed $config['guild_name'] setting. Minimal
  installation is easier and now only requires setting the
  $config['guild_id'] parameter.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Changed default configuration of
  $config['sigblock_basename'] to 'default_sigblock'.
* Improved parser debugging output. Timing output is now clearer and
  parse data size is provided.
* Fatal parser errors no longer block roster when logged in as
  administrator. Debugging output is now a trigger_error().
* Fixed error notice when roster refresh time has expired.
* Fixed last name not displaying in guild roster when 
  $config['show_lastname'] is set.
* Fixed HTML typo in Advanced Sort Options.
* EQ2 Players Rise of Kunark Release (3.4), November 12, 2007
  + Parser updated. An XML parser has been re-implemented. Use of the
    XML parser requires that PHP has been compliled with the --with-xml
    argument prior to make and make install.
  + SCHEMA CHANGE: Significant changes to the roster_master, and minor
    changes to the roster_master_guild tables. See the cpg_inst.php file
    for the new table structure.
  + CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['use_XML_parser'], default is Roster
    Master will use the XML parser if the function library is available.
  + User-provided last name data removed. Last name data is now pulled
    from the XML feed.
  + CONFIG CHANGE: Removed $config['show_currentstats'] parameter. Since
    dateJoined is no longer provided data, Newest Character cannot be
    displayed, which is the only line item in this section.
  + Added secondaryTradeskillClass and secondaryTradeskillLevel to
    roster display.
* Fixed single-column sorting not working correctly when a column header
  is clicked. Single-column sorts will now toggle between an ascending
  and descending sort as intended.
* Improved operation of the header_link() function.
* Improved functionality of text margins in signature block template.
  Text margins are now absolute relative to the base image and are only
  reduced if the avatar placement intrudes into those bounds.
* Increased default setting of $config['JPEG_quality'] from 75 to 90.
* Implemented row grouping (as per RMSA 2.3.0  Beta 4). Row grouping is
  enabled for Character Type, Rank, Adventurer Class, and Artisan Class.
  When the "Grouped" option is selected, the primary sort key will
  automatically select the group by, and that column will be removed
  from the display. Thanks goes to Lantis for implementing this
  functionality in RMSA.
* "Character Timeline Quest Claims" now read correctly instead of
  referring to Access Quests. Bug reported by Seagoat.
* Purging the roster table now resets the table last_updated date to
  zero.
* Latest Item Discovered should log cleaner now.
* Fixed level not appearing after character name in Quest Master table
  if not logged in as admin or the user that claimed the character. Bug
  reported by Bloo.
* Thanks to Seagoat for finding and correcting several bugs in new
  features in the Beta and Release Candidates.

6.1.2
* Fixed SQL error in Quest Master when
  $config['qm_exclude_inactive'] = 1 and $config['show_alts'] = 0 are
  both set. Bug reported by Faush.
  <http://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=465&topic_id=346728#4383388>
* Fixed variable scoping issue with the sync_active_claims() function
  when it's called from the cpg_inst.php file.
* Fixed "Sync Active Claims" not displaying as an administrative option
  for Quest Master.
* Fixed outdated configuration variable reference in INSTALL.txt file.
* Fixed "Display All"/"Display Primary" links not working in Quest
  Master.
  
6.1.1
* Fixed sorT order wHen guild ranks are substrings of one anothEr. Also
  fixed some unreported sorting bugs and an existing inCompAtibility
  with Postgres in the sort query. Should worK better now. Bug reportEd
  by Nomandis.
* Added AoAx4 access quest. Also added missing Deathtoll access quest
  (this quest also demonstrates the abIlity of QueSt MAster to handLe
  multI-stEp quests in any of the quest trackers). Bug reported by Bati.

6.1.0
* Repaired broken links to the EQ2i wiki that were introduced in the
  version 6.0.7 update to the quest data.
* Significant updates to quest information and links. Quest data
  structure has been reorganized.
* Quest trackers now highlight column sorts.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Removed access quests that are no longer
  required by the game.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Added roster_master_timeline table to support
  the new timeline quests.
* CONFIG CHANGE: There is now only one configuration section for Quest
  Master, rather than one for Heritage Master and Key Master.
* STRUCTURE CHANGE: Changed name of "icon_hm.png" to "icon_heritage.png"
  and added "icon_timeline.png". Added "key.jpg" icon for the Key Master
  roster.
* NEW FEATURE: Heritage Master and Key Master are now no more, and have
  been incorporated into Quest Master which now handles Heritage,
  Access, and (the oft-requested) Timeline quests. This change comes
  bundled with major changes and improvements to the quest tracker code.
* Fixed some sigblock template keyword case-sensitivity issues. The
  intent is for keywords to be cAsE-iNsEnSiTiVe.
* Added CLASS keyword to the AVATAR sigblock directive. Feature
  requested by alterEgosego.
  <http://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=405&topic_id=346728#top>
* Added Dragonfly 9.1.2.8 compatibility (new blocks class).
* Quest claim forms now group and sort like the in-game Quest Journal,
  to make entering quests easier.
* Added rm4df_update script file to aid in updating the roster from an
  external process. This is an UNSUPPORTED feature.
* Fixed Force Update link not working/not returning correctly. Force
  Update now always returns to the roster page. Bug reported by Beldak.
* Fixed JavaScript table displaying horizontal scroll bar in Firefox.
  Bug reported by Beldak.

6.0.7
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Changed primary key in roster_master table
  from Name to Character_ID, existing implementation caused uniqueness
  problems with some character sets and collations (unable to have two
  different characters whose names would only differ by their accents).
  Bug reported by Lantis.
  <http://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=345&topic_id=346728#4219967>
* Changed installer to alter the blocks table on new install as well.
  Bug reported by CammanCMC.
  <http://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=345&topic_id=346728#4221608>
* Added Unique Members statistic.
* Increased max_execution time in the HTML roster retreval loop to start
  at five minutes. NOTE: This function has no effect when PHP is running
  in safe mode. There is no workaround other than turning off safe mode
  or changing the time limit in the php.ini file. The current effective
  setting of safe mode and the PHP max_execution_time directive can be
  viewed in the Dragonfly administration panel at
  "Administration Menu > > System Info > > PHP Core". The Apache TimeOut
  directive (default of 300 seconds) is another limiting factor, the
  shorter of the two durations will be effective.
* Changed link references from www.eq2i.com to the eq2.wikia.com site.
* Roster updates through externally-managed processes (such as cron) are
  now available. First, disable automated updates by setting
  $config['cache_update_time'] = 0 in the config.inc file. Next, create
  a cron task that will launch the update like this (edit the URL
  appropriately):
  0 0,6,12,18 * * *	wget --bind-address=128.1.1.1 --output-document=/dev/null --quiet 'http://<yoursitename>/index.php?name=Roster_Master&force_update=1'
  [This example requires that wget be installed on your system and will
  update the roster every six hours. You may use any HTTP client that
  allows binding to the 128.1.1.1 (localhost) address.]
  If you have a large guild that takes a lot of time to update, you can
  do it automatically at scheduled intervals.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Changed schema to use INTEGER instead of INT,
  and SMALLINT instead of TINYINT in order to resolve PostgresSQL
  compatibility issues. Bug reported by Lantis.
  <http://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=375&topic_id=346728#4231796>
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added new bitflag to logfile parameter to log parser
  statistics and to suppress logging of guild status changes. Also
  reordered some of the lesser-used log bitflags.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['block_autoupdate'] to control whether
  Guild Wall of Fame block will now force a roster refresh if the roster
  data is stale when it goes to updates its cache. This can impace page
  load times if the update takes long (page won't load until update is
  complete). Default is off.
* REQUIREMENTS CHANGE: Use of internal Dragonfly multibyte wrappers has
  been implemented. Requires versions of Dragonfly after the 9.0.6.1
  version.

6.0.6
* Revised parser to be more UTF-8-friendly by replacing the /w?
  shorthand with a plain .*? search. Pattern strings are now treated as
  UTF-8. This modifier is available from PHP 4.1.0 or greater on Unix
  and from PHP 4.2.3 on win32. UTF-8 validity of the pattern is checked
  since PHP 4.3.5. Bug reported by Wolffire, code changes supplied by
  Lantis.

  compatibility.

6.0.5
* Re-re-fixed parser in response to changes to the way 'Latest Item

  netting the Community Choice award.

6.0.4
* Re-fixed parser in response to changes to the way 'Latest Item

6.0.3
* Fixed minor typo in config.inc comment, and another typo in
  sigmaster.inc that would cause officer archetype avatars to not be
  found. Bug reported by Seagoat.
* Fixed display of character level in Key and Signature Master. Bug
  reported by Seagoat.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['show_Arena']) to control display of
  Arena kills in block. Feature requested by Seagoat.
* Added character level to quest query display.
* Added new category to quest query display: "Not Started (Below
  Required Level -1)". This differentiates those who haven't started the
  quest from those who can't or aren't close.

6.0.2
* Changed signature image size attributes in rostermaster.inc to be
  based off of the sigblock base selected in the
  $config['sigblock_basename'] setting, based on an implementation by
  Seagoat.
  <http://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=30&topic_id=346728#3959987>
* Signature Master will now look for Class- and Archetype-specific image
  files that have spaces replaced with underscores (e.g.
  "<sigblockbasename>_Shadow_Knight.png" or "Shadow_Knight.png"). The
  previous behavior required that the space be embedded in the file

* Fixed typos in source comments.

6.0.0
* Added error message to indicate that the rank insignia feature failed
  as a result of a misconfiguration in the $config['lookup_rank'] array.
* XML parser has been removed. A hybrid HTML/CSV parser is now the
  default. As a result, and for the moment, Roster Master no longer
  requires a PHP binary compiled with XML support. Last of the legacy
  code removed from the parser.inc file.
* Fixed a long-standing logic error in *_sync_active_claims() functions.
* Fixed logic error in rostermaster.inc that would cause the "Display
  Primary" link to continue to display all characters. Bug reported by
  Excalibre3377.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Fixed guildRank field size bug for new
  installs (was VARCHAR 20 instead of VARCHAR 40). Bug reported by
  Caela.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Major changes to the schema, especially the
  roster_master table. Some changes should improve compatibility with
  PostgreSQL. Fields have been renamed or dropped! See the cpg_inst.php
  file for the new DB schema.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Changes the "content" field in the core
  Dragonfly CMS table "blocks" from type "TEXT" to "MEDIUMTEXT". This is
  to address a problem where the block size would overflow the field and
  get truncated, causing sever rendering issues when the block would
  attempt to read from its cache.  
* Added ability to sort rows by Adventurer Level in Key Master and
  Heritage Master. Code contributed by Seagoat20.
* Added fix for alpha-channel transparency in signature overlays.
  Code contributed by Seagoat20.
* Live Update #29: November 14, 2006 (Echoes of Faydwer)
  + As a result of changes in EQ2Players.com, serverside-calculated
    guild leaderboard data is no longer available.
  + New Guild Achievement data added to schema.
  + Added five new heritage quests: In Honor and Service, War and
    Wardrobe, The Staff of the Observers, Casualties of the War of
    the Fae, The Symbol in the Flesh, and Cloak of Flames. Thank you
    to Kitra for submitting code changes and images for the new heritage
    quests.
  + Changed heritage quest preferred quest provider to EQ2i.
* New avatar graphics for archetype and alpha-channel blended guild
  rank icons have been added. Many thanks to Seagoat20 for providing
  them.
* Added extended templating support for avatars in Signature Master
  based on an implementation suggested by Seagoat. New directives
  (DEFAULT|ARCH|EQ2|RANK) have been added to the AVATAR templating
  command.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added additional configuration commands to the Roster
  Master avatar display options in the roster. See the
  $config['show_avatars'] setting in the config.inc file. Based on an
  implementation suggested by Seagoat20.
* CONFIG CHANGE: New configuration setting, $config['sigblock_type'],
  has been added to support extended sigblock selections based on an
  implementation suggested by Seagoat.
* CONFIG CHANGE: New configuration setting, $config['officers'], along
  with additional constants and functions have been added to the
  config.inc file to support the extended avatar templating in both
  Roster and Signature Master.
* CONFIG CHANGE: $config['sigblock_basename'] setting replaces the
  $config['sigblock_file'] setting, and has a new semantic.
* CONFIG CHANGE: $config['show_PvP'] setting added to control the
  display of PvP statistics (which are really only relevant to PvP
  servers). Feature suggested by Dyse.
* Updated HQ icons in Heritage Master to indicate quests from
  expansions by adding a colored stripe (the color is *very*
  roughly derived from the predominant color in the expansion's
  title logo, with some fidging to make it more visible, or in
  some cases where the color choices collided, unique).
* Significant updates/clarifications to the documentation.

Special thanks to the users of Roster Master who contributed to this
major release and provided user support, enhancements, bug reports,
and bug fixes. Especially Belin, Caela, Excalibre3377, Kevlin, and
VulcanDarksoul. Extra-special special thanks goes to Seagoat20 for
exceptional support of the user base, innovative features, and donating
her time and talents to the project. Super job, folks! It's truly a
privilege to work with you.

5.1.4
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['sigblock_file'] to allow the user to
  select the signature block image file name. This file must be
  located in the "modules/{$mod_dirname}/images/sigblocks/" directory
  and readable by the web server user. If this file cannot be found,
  Signature Master will fall back to using "default_sigblock.png" in
  that directory as the file name before giving up.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['JPEG_quality'] to control the output
  quality of the signature file.
* Added category and level elements to key_quests array. Character
  access quest Claim form and access quest tooltips now display
  Quest Category and Quest Level to assist players with finding quests
  in the in-game Journal.
* NEW FEATURE: Vastly improved templating in Signature Master.
* Fixed a several typos and logic errors in Signature Master.
* Signature Master error messages when DEBUG is set are more explicit
  about what has gone wrong, and should work more predictably.
* Template for ranks excluded from having a signature have been
  removed. Instead, ranks in exclusion list will send a 404 error if
  a signature is requested. Also, the signature block link/icon will
  not be displayed for excluded ranks.

5.1.3
* Fixed lastname display logic when $config['show_lastname'] = 1,
  reported by Belin.
* Fixed CMS Warning line 66: The expected module directory,
  "Roster_Master", does not exist error reported by Kevlin.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['use_XML_parser'] to allow the user to
  force the XML parser off. Improved table display logic in the case of
  mixed XML/HTML data and to properly reflect the setting.
  NOTE1: As of May 17, EQ2Players.com is not providing the XML data
  feed, until this condition is fixed, please set this value to "FALSE"
  (the default).
  NOTE2: Use the Purge Roster Table command to remove the extended XML
  information from the roster table. This will keep oddball stuff from
  messing up your roster table since you'll have some missing columns
  otherwise. This won't muck up your Claims at all, it just forces a
  complete refresh of the roster table in the DB.
* Live Update #24: June 14, 2006; The following zones no longer require
  an access quest. The is_visible flag has been set to FALSE for these
  quests (quests that are in the DB are trackable, but will not be shown
  on the large table):
    The Firemyst Gully
    The Sanctum of Fear
    Bloodskull Valley: The Excavation Site
    The Eternal Gorge
    Miragul's Menagerie
    Icespire Summit
    The Forbidden Sepulcher

    Heroic: The Darkened Den
    Icebound
    The Bastion of Flames
    The Cove of Decay: A Treaty for Treasure
    The Ruins of Varsoon

5.1.2
* Fixed level for "Putting Maltena to Rest" to 42, reported by Voken.
* Fixed "There was an error during the parse operation" fatal error
  during the guild summary parse operation. Thanks to Kelia and
  Seagoat20 for reporting the problem.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Added "The Wonderous Inventions of a Crazed
  Gnome", "A Thorn of Old", and "Draco Mortuus Vos Liberatio" heritage
  quests. Changed "GoTD" column to "GotD".
* STRUCTURE CHANGE: Renamed file "modules/Roster_Master/images/GoTD.jpg"
  to "modules/Roster_Master/images/GotD.jpg". Added
  "modules/Roster_Master/images/BCG.jpg",
  "modules/Roster_Master/images/TB.jpg", and
  "modules/Roster_Master/images/Ws.jpg". Icon color for
  "modules/Roster_Master/images/icon_hm.png" changed from blue to a
  more appropriate gold. Added
  "modules/Roster_Master/images/caution.png".
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['read_file_hack'] to activate UNSUPPORTED
  file input hack. Don't ask about it.
* Removed the 3-day expired member deletion holdoff time. Guild members
  are immediately removed from the roster. Members who return to the
  roster will automatically re-bind to claims. Otherwise, residual
  claims can be removed from the widowed/orphaned claims administration
  interface. Thanks to Seagoat20 for suggesting the change.
* Added new option to Heritage and Key Master to hide quests from the
  roster. Set the "is_visible" element FALSE to hide it. Access quests
  for Zek, Feerrott, and Everfrost have been hidden by default. Thanks
  to Belin for suggesting it.
* Links now include both character first and last name, instead of just
  the first name. Thanks to Belin for siggesting the change.
* Parse errors no longer halt the roster if user is not logged in as a
  module (or superuser) administrator. Warning icon now appears on roster
  next to update time if the roster is overdue for an update (visible if
  $config['show_updated'] is set).
* Signature cache synchronization with the roster has been fixed.
  Roster updates should trigger a signature refresh. Thanks to Belin
  for reporting the problem. This also fixed the function of the
  signature cache reaper, which was not functioning properly.
* Improved inline comments for sigmaster.inc, based upon the signature
  block tweaking documentation created by Censeo.
* Fixed some characters' names not being listed in the class breakdowns
  (when $config['breakdown_shownames'] = 1). Bug reported by Caela.

5.1.1
* Reapplied fix for table sizing bug in Opera that caused the first
  heading column cell to stretch when the table is converted to
  scrolling. Results in a compromise in the visual style, but one that's
  not entirely unpleasant.
* SECURITY FIX:
  + Fixed XSS vulnerability for log and table purge operations.
  + Fixed XSS vulnerability for character claim deletions.
  + Fixed XSS vulnerability for signature block cache purge operation.
* Added partial French language translation, provided by Christophe
  Dauvissat.

5.1.0
* Fixed "Unknown column 'cmsusers.Char_ID' in 'on clause'" in
  rostermaster.inc (line 1412) affecting MySQL 4.0.x users, reported by
  Nomandis.
* Fixed "Unknown column 'rmu.active' in 'where clause'" in
  heritagemaster.inc (line 713) and keymaster.inc (line 913), reported
  by SandKap.
* Fixed access control problem that would prevent some operations if the
  admin was not also logged in as a user.
* Fixed time misalignment in block-Guild_Wall_of_Fame.php reported by
  Seagoat20.
* Fixed failure to load language file for anything other than the
  primary instance of the module.
* Fixed some missing localizations in page titles.
* Fixed inability to save claims for instanced versions of Roster Master
  beyond the first one (i.e. can't save claims for Roster_Master_2,
  Roster_Master_3, etc.), reported by Erladdin.
* Fixed "Force Update" function having no effect from the log display.
* STRUCTURE CHANGE: Added file
  "modules/Roster_Master/table_js.inc" to cut down on duplicated
  code between Heritage and Key Master.
* STRUCTURE CHANGE: Added file
  "modules/Roster_Master/functions/parser.inc" to break down the parsing
  functions and make way for the implementation of XML roster.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Added the "Capturing Day and Night" access
  quest.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Added lastonline, highestmeleehit, and
  highestmagichit columns for data from the XML feed.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['xml_roster_url'] to point to the XML
  roster data page.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added $config['km_rowhighlight'] and
  $config['hm_rowhighlight'] to toggle the row highlighter in Key and
  Heritage Master. Added $config['rowhighlight_color'] to control the
  on-click row highlight color. (Unfortunately, there's no way to set it
  from the theme template.)
* Added row highlighting JavaScript function to the Heritage and Key
  Master tables. Clicking the mouse locks the row highlight (in gold),
  click again anywhere on the table to unlock.
* Removed ", __FILE__, __LINE__" part in SQL method calls since it's
  obsolete.
* Added note regarding "httpd_can_network_connect=1" setting for Fedora,
  researched by Jarrod.
* Restructured the table headers for Heritage and Key Master.
* Added "Query Quest Status" link to Heritage and Key Master. This
  links to a report detailing the quest, quest reward/access, and a
  tabular listing of all characters in each of the three quest states
  (Don't Have, In Progress, and Completed). Swapping the columns and
  rows of the tables was technically feasible (even had a working
  prototype), but it wonked up the sorting mechanism (which would
  have had to be redone from scratch), and just didn't look good at all.
* Added XML guild roster parser. To parse XML with PHP, you must
  configure PHP with the --with-xml argument prior to make and make
  install. Roster Master will automatically fall back to using the HTML
  parser if the XML parser doesn't exist or fails. NOTE: The XML feed
  sends KVD data as integer, not float data types. You lose a little
  precision as a result. Go figure.
* Added segments to Guild Wall of Fame Block for Highest Melee Hit,
  Highest Magic Hit, and Most Recent Member Online (latter is commented
  out). Note that all three only display if the XML roster data is
  present.
* Added logging options for highest melee/magic hit and last online.
* Updated required levels for heritage quests.
* Changed source file headers to use ISO 8601 date format.

5.0.1
* Reverted roster_master_key column names to eliminate colon (":")
  characters from use. MySQL 4.0 doesn't properly handle quoted
  identifiers in update queries...
* Fixed heritage quest tracker links in character manager.

5.0.0
* Re-fixed "Guild Summary: $field was..." in logfile problem.
* Added administration command to purge the log. If log is empty, an
  appropriate message is displayed when the log is viewed.
* Fixed "Data array mismatch." error when editing heritage quest claims,
  reported by Belin.
* Re-fixed error in the way that Roster Master handles timestamps that
  introduced a serious error in the way that Signature Master handled
  the signature block cache.
* NEW FEATURE: Added the first version of Roster Master's Key Master
  in response to a request by Kevlin.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Heritage quests moved to their own table.
  Added lastname column to roster_master_users table. Added
  roster_master_keys table.
* CONFIG CHANGE: Added configuration section for the Key Master.
  Renamed configuration variables for the Heritage Master. Added
  $config['show_lastname'] variable to Roster Feature Options.
* STRUCTURE CHANGE: In accordance with the Dragonfly coding standards,
  the language file have been moved from the original location at
  "modules/Roster_Master/language/lang-english.php" to
  "language/english/roster_master.php". Those upgrading should remove
  the previous directory before installing the upgrade. Bonus feature -
  there is no need to make additional copies of the language file(s)
  when using the automatic instantiation feature.
* Improved response in returning a signature image by specifying the
  HTTP connection closes immediately.
* Reorganized Signature Master's options to group the appearance
  options for the signature block image in response to feedback from
  Erladdin. Changing the block still requires editing the sigmaster.inc
  file. Improved comments to assist customization.
* Renamed internal functions to be more consistent with the component
  (Roster Master, Heritage Master, Key Master, Signature Master) they
  belong to.
* Rewrote the claims management user interface. It is now possible to
  edit a claim, rather than only delete it. Added the ability to add a
  last name to a character claim.
* Improved some error-handling functions and logic.
* Moved Heritage/Key Master sort menu to the left to improve the UI.

4.0.1
* Two bugs and a suggestion by Belin:
  + Fixed problem with config['show_avatars'] = 1 not showing username
    in row data.
  + Fixed it so that rostermaster and signaturemaster functions both
    look for PNG avatars, instead of JPG and PNG.
  + Signature link now honors the $config['popup'] setting.
* Fixed Character Quest Claims page returning a blank page on save,
  found by Kanoldari.
* Fixed "Guild Summary: $field was..." in logfile, found by Seagoat20.
* In response to suggestions by Kanoldari:
  + Claim Character page is now called Manage Characters.
  + Added icon links to Edit Quest Claims and the Signature blocks to
    each claimed character.
  + Character names in claim managers now link to the Sony character
    page.
  + Added $config['exclude_inactive'] setting to exclude characters with
    no active heritage quests in the listing of characters in the
    Heritage Quest Tracker. Thanks to Saint Peter for help with
    implementation ideas.

4.0.0
* Added the first version of the dynamic signature generator. Roster
  Master now can generate graphical signature blocks, a much-requested
  feature! Thanks goes to Belin for testing and commentary on this
  feature.
* Headshots are now called avatars, and have been moved to the
  modules\Roster_Master\images\avatars directory. The avatar images are
  used for both the signature block and the roster, and should be no
  larger than 100x100. Avatar files must be named by Character ID
  number (e.g. "281167207.png"), and in PNG format. Character ID is used
  rather than name, as character names are not assured to be valid
  filenames (especially in non-English localizations). Added the
  $config['show_avatars'] configuration variable to remove the
  requirement to edit the module source in order to enable this feature.
* Fixed error in link for the GLS that would send you to the item for
  GoTD, found by Nomandis.
* Fixed Heritage Master sorting descending to be default, reported by
  Belin.
* Added option to have character names in the fold-down class breakdown
  list in the block, as requested by Kelia.
* Replaced calls to date() with gmdate() where we were dealing with GMT
  times, as date() causes problems with Daylight Savings Time.
* Modularized code. Functions have been broken up into multiple files
  to improve readability and maintainability.
* Significantly reworked Guild Wall of Fame block. More options for
  displaying data in the block, more example display lines, more
  choices. Added additional configuration options to "Block Feature
  Options" in config.inc file, as suggested (with sample code) by Belin.
* Implemented first cut at localization support. This adds the
  languages directory, and the English language localization.
  Note that the explanatory text for some error functions isn't yet
  supported.
* Improved carry-through of alt display for other Roster Master
  functions.
* Added delete confirmation for claims. Improved autoreturn back to
  calling page for both table purge and claim deletion.
* Cleaned up code headers and comments.
* Cleaned up and expanded documentation.

3.1.2
* Fixed error in Headshot examples, found by Erladdin.
* Fixed block caching error, found by Seagoat20.
* Fixed $exclude_alts not being propagated to the read_db() function,
  found by Belin.

3.1.1
* Fixed major problems introduced in the sort code as a result of the
  changes made to accommodate alt exclusion. Pointed out by Seagoat20,
  but actually more extensive than even that...

3.1.0
* Made error messages more consistent for conditions where a client
  attempts to hand-craft an invalid URL to inject GET operations
  they aren't entitled to access.
* Fixed condition where roster_master_guild table isn't removed
  upon uninstall.
* Changed installer to add one row at a time to the
  roster_master_guild table.
* Made changes to guild summary stats to cut down on logging spam.
  New logging bitflag added.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Moved table_updated field out of the
  config_custom table and into the roster_master_guild table to keep
  Roster Master data together.
* Roster Master will now check and refresh data upon accesses to the
  Roster and Heritage Master pages. Rewrote update_data() function.
* The Force Update command should return you to the page you pushed it
  from. Untainted $rm variable to support this change.
* Fixed Last Updated time not displaying correctly on first pageload
  after a data refresh.
* Added $config['show_alts'] parameter, as requested by Kanoldari.
* Non-primaries excluded from statistics when $config['show_alts'] is
  false and the full roster is not being displayed, as requested by
  Belin. Significant changes made to Guild Wall of Fame block.
  Moved configuration parameters to config.inc to support these
  changes.
* Added $config['scrolltable'] parameter, as requested by Kanoldari.
* Added fetch_URL() function as a work-around to the prevailing attitude
  hosting providers have taken that setting
  "php_admin_value allow_url_fopen 0" (which disables the URL-aware
  fopen() wrappers that enable accessing an URL object like files and
  also subsequently blocks runtime modification of the parameter)
  actually counts as proactive security.
* Fixed missing style in Headshot cell, pointed out by Kelia.
* Increased size of Rank field to 40 characters. Thanks to Singman and
  Svens of Destin de Norrath for researching this.
* Moved changedlog out of index.php and into CHANGELOG.txt, also
  restored entire version history.

3.0.0
* DATAVASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Added parser and table for Guild summary
  information. Roster Master now allows you to track and display more
  information about your guild, including Guild Level!
* Significant changes to Guild Wall of Fame block. More guild statistics
  displayed and more available in commented source.
* Added sort feature to Heritage Master.
* Changed do_commands() Menu header to indicate when you are in the
  Heritage Master.
* Added prototype for "headshots" column, as requested by Kelia.
* Added option to sort fields descending by default (see 'inv_srt'
  element of $sort_options array) as requested by Belin.
* Fixed missing title attribute in the Heritage Master header images.
* Changed heritage item reward links to point to the OGaming database,
  since Sony's DB is restricted to subscribers.
* Cleaned up commented roster header and row code. Removed obsolete
  comments warning about changing a COLSPAN attribute that no longer
  apply. Thanks Kelia!
* Improved the logic on the guild name sanity check.
* Removed fetch_data_db() function, it's been inlined.
* Changed structure of the Heritage Master table layout.
* Minor code cleanup/reorganization.

2.1.0
* Added automatic module instantiation feature.
* Heritage quest claim form now returns back to Heritage Master,
  rather than to itself.
* Reworked the Heritage Master status icons to be more dark-background
  friendly, as per Kelia's request.
* Added nowrap style to first column of the Heritage Master table.
* Replaced SoR icon with one matching the current style.

2.0.2
* Fixed dual HTML/logic bug in quest claim form that would cause
  problems with quests that were too high for the character to start,
  but that had quest starter items not being displayed/saved correctly.

2.0.1
* Fixed off-by-one error in the table heading thCornerR style.
* Changed to stricter inline styling, rather than using element
  attributes.
* Cleaned up some comments.
* Fixed installer warning not displaying.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Added "An Ancient Desert Power" heritage
  quest.

2.0.0
* First version of Roster Master's Heritage Master.
  Features a unique JavaScript/CSS scrolling and resizable table. The
  table can be resized by dragging the horizontal rule between the
  bottom of the table and the table footer up and down.
* New DB schema: character ID and user ID are now used as primary
  indicies, rather than names (more resiliant to character and CMS
  user account changes). New schema is currently not compatible with
  previous versions of Roster Master.
* Stricter controls on operations based on user_id.
* Combined Class and Level columns, as suggested by Seagoat20.
  Completely rewrote the header code.
* Showing sort direction indicators is now configurable.
* Cut down on the wasteful logic in the mode selector.
* Improved redirect logic w.r.t. determining HTTP_REFERER.
* Fixed sort selector not working for the two-column sort.
* Fixed parser error - KVD can be BLANK.
* Re-baselined the Changelog for Version 2.

1.1.1
* Removed use of ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause that created a
  dependancy on MySQL 4.1.0 or later reported by Nomandis.
* Fixed bug in update_data() that would cause characters with no changes
  to be removed from the DB after 3 days, and then subsequently get
  added back in as a "new" character.
* Massively simcomplexified (take *that*, Merriam-Webster!) the parser
  routines. New parser should be more resistant to localization and
  custom rank issues since it directly parses the page and no longer
  uses delimters to mark fields. A side-effect is a lot of the
  preprocessing of the data is no longer needed.
* Added administration command to purge the roster_master table of
  parsed data. This command does not affect the claims table. Note that
  purging the table will cause all members to be logged as "new" when
  the data is refreshed (as intended).

1.1.0
* Fix for quotes by Grimgroth expanded to names and Class/Artisan names
  to cover localization issues:
* Made behavior more robust for the case where Roster Master can not
  contact the eq2players.com site. Changed use of cpg_error() to
  trigger_error() function. Roster Master will no longer present the
  user with an error page.
* The function of the rm_data_parse.php file has been moved into the
  update_data() function. Installations that are upgrading Roster Master
  can remove the rm_data_parse.php file.
* Added options to log data fetch retries and failures to
  $config['logfile'] parameter.
* Added $config['retries'] parameter to control how many times Roster
  Master will retry eq2players.com on a data refresh. Most users should
  never need to change it from "0". IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO SET IT
  ABOVE A VALUE OF "2"!
* Added "Unskilled" to Art_Class enum, as per mortis42's message:
* Fixed inconsistent use of time() functions noted by Belin.
* Added sort direction indicators to row headings.
* Removed PHP closing tags from files.
* Cleaned up some comments and stray whitespace.
* Fixed error in cpg_inst.php that affected upgrading installations.
* Improved efficiency of DB storage. We no longer dump and rebuild
  the table on an update. Instead, only changed or expired rows
  are sent to the DB.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: The Last_Updated column is now set to the date
  the row was updated, rather than the date the table was updated. A row
  in the config_custom table has been created to handle dating the
  table.
* Changed default ranks to match eq2players.com.

1.0.5
* Applied SQL query simplification by Nomandis.
* Applied fix to _user table prefix by Topiatic.
* Fixed logging bitflags not properly skipping Quests and KVD changes,
  was using the wrong syntax (used next() instead of continue()).
* Cleaned up some comments.
* Reworked the page header to display more consistently, especially
  with options.
* Added guild name and link to guild page on eq2players.com to the
  'show_updated' section of the page header.

1.0.4
* Changed KVD% column to KVD, it's not a percentage.
* Converted to complex (curly) syntax, where applicable.
* Updated installer.
* Added breadcrumbs to title display.
* Changed menu to not display redundant options.
* Time last updated now stored as gmtime(), rather than time().
* Changed refresh interval to every 6 hours.
* Added more flexible logging options.

1.0.3
* Minor code style cleanup.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Applied patch for new in-game arbitrary rank
  names, there needs to be a change made in to the SQL tables in order
  for the ranks to be recorded correctly. The Dragonfly installer will
  handle the table modification automatically on an upgrade.
* Rewrote query strings to use lower-case exclusively (mod_rewrite
  under Windows rewrites the URL to lower case for some reason).
* Logfile is no longer written/read as HTML to prevent malicious
  code injection into the log for hosted service users that must leave
  the logfile world-writable. Logfile renamed to "logfile.inc".
* Added dropdown list of unclaimed characters to Manage Claims
  interface.
* Documentation and GPL files added to archive.
* Forced update in fetch_data_db() now checks to see if it was called
  by a registered user.
* The rm_save_claim() function now checks to see if user is an
  administrator before accepting a POSTed username for a claim.
* CMS username in roster now links to the user's public profile.
* DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGE: Fully parses and stores the guild roster (now
  tracks Quests and KVD). Change required to the roster_master table
  schema. The upgrader will DROP the existing table and recreate it with
  the new schema.
* Automatically normalizes claim CMS username's capitalization.

1.0.2
* Applied Robbi's fix to rm_data_parse.php for KvD > 1000.
* Changed code formatting/commenting to make it more consistent.
* Reworked roster table header.
* Added drop-down list of unclaimed characters to user claim form,
  instead of a text entry field.
* Added additional error checks to claims management. It should no
  longer be possible to claim a non-existent character, or to
  claim a character for an user that does not exist.
* Distinguish widowed/orphaned claims in claims management.
* Converted most strings to string literals, where appropriate.
* Sort options now get remembered across sort operations.
* Added XHTML 1.0 Transitional compatibility to output.
* Improved layout of page elements.
* Resolved PHP warnings.
* Removed obsolete /docs directory.
* Moved rm_config.php options into index.php - there's only a few
  options, and saves on having to protect the config file.
* Added Dragonfly cpg_inst.php un|installer. Removed rm_install()
  function.
* Removed CSS style sheet, replaced with Dragonfly styles: forumline,
  nav, statlink, thCornerL, thCornerR, thTop.
* Removed search buttons - button style is handled by theme CSS.
* Added Dragonfly username search to claims management (uses
  class="post").
* Removed DB error traps to take advantage of those built into
  Dragonfly and to prevent information leaks (end users will not
  see raw SQL queries).
* Replaced calls for fatal errors to error_message() with cpg_error().
* Replaced calls to Header() with url_redirect().
* Replaced module URLs with calls to getlink().
* Replaced user input untainting with Fix_Quotes().
* Removed $config from globals in read_db().
